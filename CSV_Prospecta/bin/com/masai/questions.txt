1. How will you tackle the challenge above?
=========================================
To tackle This challenge I followed the following steps :---

-- firstly inside the main method, I create one object of bufferedReader by supplying reader object and named it reader.
-- from reader i read given line and convert it into array by spliting from comma
-- insert every element of array in array.
-- substring before ":" treader as key and after double column treated as value
-- now get the set of keys from the map and iterate through it
-- now checking that if value length is more then 1 then it is formula and need to solve it otherwise continue.



2. What type of errors you would you check for?
===========================================
-- i checked for that file name is correct.
-- use loops to take key and values because it might possible that column name will "A456" so if i took only two as given in example then it
will cause error.
-- make sure that  arithmatic operator is appropriate and we solve formula accordingly
-- while reading the file need to make sure that we get all values.



3. How might a user break your code?
==================================
-- if file name is wrong or path is wrong the we might get the fileNotfoudn Exception.
-- I haven't provided such cases if there is a formula in which we are multiplying or dividing or minus. we need  to create cases
in switch and call appropriate methods.
-- if someone add number more then 9 in formula like "A5+100" then we might get error
