3) Question: what are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it is secure 
and reliable?


To ensure that api is sucure and reliable we need to follow following steps :-->

1. Create different - 2 packages for model, service, reposiotry and controller to maintain the code.

2. we need to handle all the appropriate Exceptions and throw the custom Exception where it is required which makes
API strong and secure.

3. we can use Hateoas(Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State ) in our API which makes our API reliable.

4. Authenticate and autherize the user.

5. use Validation so that user can sent only valid request.

6 Monitoring the API by using Actuator which monitor health of API.

7. use appropriate HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE  for intended action.
